PHYSICS: ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM

INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRICITY

Electricity is a form of energy resulting from the movement of charged particles, such as electrons. It is a fundamental force of nature that powers our modern world, from lighting our homes to powering our computers and communication devices.

Electric charge is a fundamental property of matter. There are two types of electric charge: positive and negative. Like charges repel each other, while opposite charges attract. The SI unit of electric charge is the coulomb (C).

ELECTRIC CURRENT

Electric current is the flow of electric charge through a conductor. It is measured in amperes (A), where 1 ampere = 1 coulomb per second.

Current (I) = Charge (Q) / Time (t)

There are two types of electric current:
1. Direct Current (DC): Current flows in one direction only
2. Alternating Current (AC): Current changes direction periodically

ELECTRIC POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE (VOLTAGE)

Electric potential difference, or voltage, is the work done per unit charge to move a charge between two points in an electric field. It is measured in volts (V).

Voltage (V) = Work Done (W) / Charge (Q)

OHM'S LAW

Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points, provided the temperature remains constant.

V = I × R

Where:
- V = voltage (volts)
- I = current (amperes)
- R = resistance (ohms)

RESISTANCE

Resistance is the opposition to the flow of electric current. It depends on:
1. Length of the conductor (longer = more resistance)
2. Cross-sectional area (thicker = less resistance)
3. Material (some materials conduct better than others)
4. Temperature (resistance usually increases with temperature)

ELECTRIC CIRCUITS

An electric circuit is a closed loop through which electric current can flow. There are two main types:

Series Circuit:
- Components connected end-to-end
- Same current flows through all components
- Total resistance = sum of individual resistances
- Total voltage = sum of individual voltages

Parallel Circuit:
- Components connected across common points
- Same voltage across all components
- Total current = sum of individual currents
- Total resistance decreases as more components are added

MAGNETISM

Magnetism is a force associated with magnetic fields and moving electric charges. A magnetic field is the region around a magnet where magnetic forces can be detected.

Magnetic fields are produced by:
1. Permanent magnets
2. Electromagnets (coils of wire carrying current)
3. Moving charges

ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION

Electromagnetic induction is the production of electric current by varying magnetic fields. This principle is used in:
- Electric generators
- Transformers
- Induction cookers

Faraday's law states that the induced electromotive force (EMF) is equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux.

TRANSFORMERS

Transformers are devices that can change the voltage of an alternating current. They work on the principle of electromagnetic induction.

For an ideal transformer:
Vp/Vs = Np/Ns = Is/Ip

Where:
- Vp = primary voltage
- Vs = secondary voltage
- Np = number of primary turns
- Ns = number of secondary turns
- Is = secondary current
- Ip = primary current
